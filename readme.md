bmv2 is a text transformation model focused on converting player behaviour captured in video format into modifiable game code. The process involves transforming video data into images, then extracting text from these images, which is subsequently translated into mod code. This mod code is used to describe player actions and game states within the Civilization VI codebase, such as UnitPriorityBoosts in the AiFavoredItems table or DefaultImprovements in the AiLists table.

// TODO: Review and design the architecture for the video to image to text to mod code conversion process.
